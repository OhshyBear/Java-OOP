This repository contains a collection of Java projects demonstrating various core programming concepts such as data manipulation, object-oriented design, sorting algorithms, file I/O, and GUI creation.

**Projects Overview**<br>
**📁 Project 1:** Random Number Generation & IPv6 Address Validator
FirstHomework.java: Generates random numbers using Random and ThreadLocalRandom classes, comparing methods.

Ipv6.java: Validates IPv6 address format, checking length, segment count, and valid characters.

**📁 Project 2:** Array Manipulation and File Data Handling
OddEven.java: Checks if odd numbers appear before even numbers in an array.

ShiftRight.java: Rotates an integer array to the right by one position.

TestNumFileArr.java: Reads numbers from a file into an array and manipulates data with file I/O.

**📁 Project 3:** String Sorting and Insertion Algorithms
StringSort.java: Implements ascending order string sort using ASCII comparisons.

DescendingStringSort.java: Implements descending order string sort.

TestInsert.java: Reads strings from a file, applies sorting, and handles array insertion.

**📁 Project 4**: ArrayList Sorting and Manipulation
ArrayListSort.java: Implements an insertion sort for an ArrayList of Double values.

DoubleMorph.java: Doubles the size of an input list by replacing each integer with two halves.

TestNumFileAL.java: Loads integers from a file, manipulates the list with random insertions and clean file handling.

**📁 Project 5:** Working with Custom Classes and Object Manipulation
MyPoint.java: Defines a 2D point with methods for distance calculation.

Shape.java: Defines a geometric shape with a center point and color.

Homework5Main.java: Demonstrates functionality of MyPoint and Shape objects.

**📁 Project 6:** HR System – Employee Management with Inheritance
HT54Employee.java: Abstract class for employee data, with an annual bonus method.

HT54Staff.java: Represents staff members, calculates bonuses, and links managers.

HT54Manager.java: Inherits from HT54Staff, manages a list of employees.

HT54TestHr.java: Driver class to test the HR system and relationships.

**📁 Project 7:** HT54 Email Subscription GUI
HT54Gui.java: A JavaFX application for managing email subscriptions with validation and duplicate prevention.

**📁 Project 8:** eBay Earnings Calculator GUI
HT54GUIProject.java: A JavaFX tool for calculating eBay store earnings, factoring in fees, offers, and acquisition costs.
